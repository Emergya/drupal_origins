Drupal Origins is a basic drupal distribution for starting new drupal projects quickly and with some some of the most common modules pre configured.
Drupal origins add by default the Da vinci theme also.

For get a first version, the active development is under Github in this repository. You can see the current state of this project at : https://github.com/Emergya/drupal_origins
